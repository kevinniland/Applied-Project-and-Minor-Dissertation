\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter introduces the project. It discusses the origins of the project idea and the aims of the project.

\section{Sorting Algorithms}
In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order.

\section{Aim of the project}
The aim of this project is to create a web-based application that allows users to visualize various different sorting algorithms, allow user authentication and upload to visualizations to a database from which other users can view and compare the performance.
