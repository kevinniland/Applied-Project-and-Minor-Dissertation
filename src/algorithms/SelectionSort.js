     * Performs the selection sort algorithm
     * 
     * Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based 
     * algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted 
     * part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list. The 
     * smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element 
     * becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to 
     * the right. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities 
     * are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
     *
