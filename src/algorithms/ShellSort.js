     * Performs shell sort algorithm. 
     * 
     * Shell sort is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) 
     * or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then 
     * progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the 
     * gap sequence it uses. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities 
     * are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
     * 
     * @param {*} array - Array to be sorted
     * @param {*} sortHistory - Elements that have been sorted
     * @param {*} selectedHistory - Elements that have been previously selected for sorting
